# Rainfall Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project involves applying different classification algorithms to predict whether there will be rain the following day using the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's rainfall dataset.

## Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R2-Score
